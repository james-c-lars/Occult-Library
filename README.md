The base of an incomplete game

Currently has a working combat system for non player controlled entities, and five different entities with different sets of actions
Each entity has a set of actions that alter the health and focus of itself or other entities as well as applying lasting statuses to entities
These statuses affect different actions in many different ways.

The current AI for combat is slightly different for each entity, but in general moves and targets are chosen randomly.
